# pv-library-java
A small little library made for self-practice purposes from topics I learned in and out of class, all written in standard Java.

`pv3199.lib.java` is the current default structure of the library and is followed by these subpackages:
+ `math`: mathematical utilities involving fractions, complex numbers, and polar coordinates
  + `structures`: mathematical structures involving matrices and vectors
+ `util`: development utilities involving arrays, graphs, trees, sorting and searching methods, and linked lists
