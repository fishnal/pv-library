# pv-library-java
A small little library made for self-practice purposes from topics I learned in and out of class, all written in standard Java.

`pv3199.lib.java` is the current default structure of the library and is followed by these subpackages:
+ [`image`](src/main/java/pv3199/lib/java/image): image utilities involving RGB value isolation
+ [`math`](src/main/java/pv3199/lib/java/math): mathematical utilities involving fractions, complex numbers, and polar coordinates
  + [`structures`](src/main/pv3199/lib/java/math/structures): mathematical structures involving matrices and vectors
+ [`util`](src/main/pv3199/lib/java/math/util): development utilities involving arrays, graphs, trees, sorting and searching methods, and linked lists
